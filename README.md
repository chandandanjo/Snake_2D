# Snake_2D
Simple snake game using **turtle module** within python in an **object oriented manner**.
This project is useful for beginner and intermediate level programmers to better understand the concept of python.

This project covers following topics :-
###### 1. Object oriented programming.
       - Concept of class.
       - Constructors (Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. 
                       The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created.
                       In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.)
       - Methods (a function that “belongs to” an object.)
       - Class attributes.
       - Instantiating a class.
###### 2. Conditional statements (if-else, while & for loop).
###### 3. Turtle module (creating turtles and performing various functions with it).
###### 4. Time module (add delays in code execution).
###### 5. Random module (generating pseudo-random numbers and choices).
###### 6. String formatting.
###### 7. Generating logics.
